A branch is a series of changes to a repository which are held separately from the master sequence.



A branch is a way of being able to make a sequence of changes to the master version of a 
repository and then being able to merge those changes back into the master version.

If and when a merge of a branch to the master is requested Git will handle this without
the need for user intervention unless changes have been made to the master version that clash
with what's been done in the branch.
